A total implementation of parser combinators, as documented in the
(forthcoming) paper Structurally Recursive Descent Parsing by Nils
Anders Danielsson and Ulf Norell.

This code depends on the Agda standard library. Note that you have to
use library code from a suitable date to make things work. (If you use
only the patches originating before the creation date of the last
patch in this repository then things usually work.)
