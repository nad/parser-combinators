Note that this repository contains a number of different
implementations of parser combinators (including lots of code overlap,
and some modules in which the termination checker has been switched
off). This is mostly for historical reasons. The modules which we
recommend you to take a look at if you are interested in this work are
all listed in Recommended.agda.
