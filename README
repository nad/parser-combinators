A total implementation of parser combinators
Nils Anders Danielsson and Ulf Norell
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This implementation is partly described in "Mixing Induction and
Coinduction" (by Nils Anders Danielsson and Thorsten Altenkirch) and
partly described in "Structurally Recursive Descent Parsing" (by Nils
Anders Danielsson and Ulf Norell). The latter paper may currently be a
bit out of date.

See StructurallyRecursiveDescentParsing.README for a listing and brief
explanation of the modules making up this project.

Tested using Agda 2.2.4 and version 0.2 of Agda's standard library.
